                She clutched the matron by the arm, and forcing her into a chair
                by the bedside, was about to speak, when looking round, she
                caught sight of the two old women bending forward in the
                attitude of eager listeners. They belong to the old gentleman,
                said Oliver, wringing his hands; to the good, kind, old
                gentleman who took me into his house, and had me nursed, when I
                was near dying of the fever . Oh, pray send them back; send him
                back the books and money . Keep me here all my life long; but
                pray, pray send them back...

                Looking cautiously round, to ascertain that they were not
                overheard, the two hags cowered nearer to the fire, and chuckled
                heartily. Nancy stooped below the shutters, and Oliver heard the
                sound of a bell. They crossed to the opposite side of the
                street, and stood for a few moments under a lamp. A noise, as if
                a sash window were gently raised, was heard; and soon afterwards
                the door softly opened. Mr. Sikes then seized the terrified boy
                by the collar with very little ceremony; and all three were

                At length one of them called out in a clear, polite, smooth
                dialect, not unlike in sound to the Italian: and therefore I
                returned an answer in that language, hoping at least that the
                cadence might be more agreeable to his ears. But it must be
                observed, that this island cannot move beyond the extent of the
                dominions below, nor can it rise above the height of four miles.
                For which the astronomers (who have written large systems
                concerning the stone) assign the following reason: that the

                Now the races of these two have been for some ages utterly
                extinct, and besides to discourse any further of them would not
                be at all to my purpose. But the concern I have most at heart is
                for our Corporation of Poets, from whom I am preparing a
                petition to your Highness, to be subscribed with the names of
                one hundred and thirty-six of the first race, but whose immortal
                productions are never likely to reach your eyes, though each of
                them is now an humble and an earnest appellant for the laurel,
                and has large comely volumes ready to show for a support to his
                pretensions...

                She gave my mother such a turn, that I have always been
                convinced I am indebted to Miss Betsey for having been born on a
                Friday. The word was appropriate to the moment. My mother was so
                much worse that Peggotty, coming in with the teaboard and
                candles, and seeing at a glance how ill she was, - as Miss
                Betsey might have done sooner if there had been light enough, -
                conveyed her upstairs to her own room with all speed; and
                immediately dispatched Ham Peggotty, her nephew, who had been
                for some days past secreted in the house...
